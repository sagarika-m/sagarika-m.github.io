            <ul>
                <li>Power your home with renewable energy: You can use solar panels to power your home. Even though it may sound expensive, but once the solar panels get hooked up, power can't go out. When the sun is down or there is a storm,
                    the panels will store energy from the earlier sunlight, and power your house. Even when sunny, the house will still have power.

                 <li>
                     Eat what you buy: If continuing to waste food, more energy is being used to plant, raise, ship, package, and sell food. By eating what you buy, less carbon emissions go into the atmosphere.
                 </li>
                 <li>
                     Stop excessive use of energy: Pulling the plugs out of sockets you are not using it helps stop energy pumping which saves the amount of carbon emissions. Even turning off light switches when you are not using it helps, too.
