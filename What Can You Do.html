        <p>
            There are many expensive and affordable ways to stop climate change. Even the smallest change you do, can help stop climate change. Below are some affordable to expensive ways to help stop climate change.

            <ul>
                <li>Power your home with renewable energy: You can use solar panels to power your home. Even though it may sound expensive, but once the solar panels get hooked up, power can't go out. When the sun is down or there is a storm,
                    the panels will store energy from the earlier sunlight, and power your house. Even when sunny, the house will still have power.
                </li>
                 <li>
                     Eat what you buy: If continuing to waste food, more energy is being used to plant, raise, ship, package, and sell food. By eating what you buy, less carbon emissions go into the atmosphere.
                 </li>
                 <li>
                     Stop excessive use of energy: Pulling the plugs out of sockets you are not using it helps stop energy pumping which saves the amount of carbon emissions. Even turning off light switches when you are not using it helps, too.
                 </li>
                 <li>
                     Buy an electric car: Buying an electric car can actually reduce your carbon footprint. Even though it still pumps energy, it won't pump as much as using a gasoline car. Until the first solar car comes out, this is the best option.
                 </li>
                 <li>
                     Reuse anything: By resuing old items, you contribute less to landfills. Some ways to resue items are to use items are to use cardboard boxes from amazon packages, etc. to store old files, documents, etc. You can also use plastic egg cartons to grow your own garden.
                 </li>
                 <li>
                     Stop using plastic: Pumping energy out of the ground usually goes to plastic packaging, and what is the main source of ocean pollution. Instead, use reuasble straws, water bottles, bags, etc.
                 </li>
                 <li>
                     Donate to local charities, conservation groups, activists, your time to volunteer, help out or giving money to help fund them.(more description on next page)
                 </li>
                 <li>
                     Finally speak up!: Even as small as posting something on social media to as big as a peaceful protest at your Government office, everything helps!
