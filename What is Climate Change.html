        Climate change is the effect of temperature after tons of carbon emissions(fossil fuels) have entered the atmosphere. These carbon tons get released after driving your car, traveling by bus, airplane, train, etc. 
        As the earth heats up, the sea levels also rise, leaving beach towns and islands very dangerous to live in. The fear of a flood becomes more and more drastic, especially in places floods aren't very common. Climate change can also be refered to as <i>global warming</i>.
        Due to the reference and the other name of climate change(global warming), the idea is mainly just the earth is heating up. That is partially true. Yes, the earth is heating up, but that isn't all. Climate change can result in crazier weather patterns such as getting harsher winds, tornadoes, hurricanes, etc. 
        The impact is very hard on farmers. Farmers in northern India got half of their season's rainfall in a matter of 5 hours. All the crops drowned and were ruined. One glacier in Alaska is melting very quickly. In the path we are going, in 50 years, there won't be a glacier there anymore. 
        With glaciers melting, it leaves sea levels rising, arctic animals no where to go and all army, navy, etc. bases in the Arctic and Antarctic, to be drowned soon. To learn more, below are some links to differnet websites, book titles, documentaries, and Ted Talks that talk about climate change.
        Just copy paste the links into a new tab and they will show up, for the book just copy paste the title.</p>
